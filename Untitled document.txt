Hello, my name is Ayvan Davoren and I am a 1st year Electrical Engineering Major. I like to play video games, do calculus (that is not a joke), and make friends (do not be afraid to reach out please I want friends). I do not have any strict goals for the fall 2023 year, but I mainly want to learn as much as I can about electronics. I have been interested in electronics as a kid, but through middle school and high school  I just stopped caring about it. Over the summer I had a profound interest in electronics and wanted to learn more. This club seemed very appealing to me, and the intro project did not let me down as a learning tool. 
I didn't really have any specific interest in anything electronically, I was just interested in how it worked, but after doing the intro project, I found I really enjoyed most of the process. The PCB was my favorite part though and I would like to learn more about PCB design. I look forward to learning more this year.
