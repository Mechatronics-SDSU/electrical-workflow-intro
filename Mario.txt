Hey, my names Mario. My goals for this Fall of 2023 are to develop my skills further and get ahead in my classes through hands on projects. I want to complete projects that I can add to my resume and make myself a better candidate for jobs in the future. My main interests that I'd like to learn about are CPU's and microcontrollers.
