Hi, my name is Jonathan Smith, and I am a third year electrical engineering student. this semester I want to become more involve on campus, as well as get hands on experience with research, design, and projects. Specifically in Mechatronics I want to learn more about good PCB design and circuit design practice. Additionally, I want to learn more about circuit elements that I've had limited exposure to in class and any other essential knowledge as a future engineer.
