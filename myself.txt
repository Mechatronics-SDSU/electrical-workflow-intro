##My name is Sophia Garcia##

I will be entering SDSU as a Junior under the Computer Engineering major. 
My college experience began at the San Diego COmmunity College District in which I completed my general education and premajor courses for the engineering major. I enjoyed the community college experience as a smooth transition from high school formatted learning to college independant education. 
I look forward to socializing and working amongst the SDSU Mechatronics team and the upcoming submarine season to learn and grow as an engineer.
