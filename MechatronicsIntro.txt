My name is Felix Monasterio and Im an EE major. My goals for this semester are mainly to do well in my classes and actually grasp the concepts being taught. I am currently learning assembly language and hope to have a game finished by the end of the semester. I am really open to learning from anyone and don't have a main area of focus as of right now.
