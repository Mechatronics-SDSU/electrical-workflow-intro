Hello, I'm Raymond and my main goal for the Fall 2022 semester regarding schooling is to main a B average across my classes which I think is a 3.0? Another goal I have for the Fall 2022 semester is to better understanding electronics and electrical engineering on a more practical level through my time in Mechatronics. A particular interest I have is a hands on experience of what working with electronics is since the theory and math behind electrical engineering is cool but I wanna actually hold something in my hand beside a pencil.
