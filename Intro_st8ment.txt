My name is Stu; I've been in the purgatory of intro project 
status for a bit now. I'm past extenuating circumstances and
happy to be here. I'm interested in motors, e.g. 
i hand wound a DC motor. There's not much sophistocated 
about a brushed permenat magenet motor - it's my broken
record flagship thing. I'd like to learn about BLDC 
phase firing sequence or just driving them in general.
I'm interested in control systems beyond my general
interest there. So - yup - happy to be here.
