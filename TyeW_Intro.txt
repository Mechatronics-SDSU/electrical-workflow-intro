Hi my name is Tye and I am a second year computer engineering major! I am a commuter and am local to San Diego. 
I like gaming, reading, rock climbing, and I'm in the University Chorus. I am BowTye#1386 on Discord.
My main goals for this semester are to meet more people within COMPE/EE as well as to learn more about what specific area of COMPE/EE I am most interested in.
I hope everyone's semester is going well, and I hope to meet all of you soon! :)
